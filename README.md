# Capix Code

The CLI coding assistant for the Capix network — built-in Capix LLM provider, Covenant governance, and Dev Token rewards. Bundled inside Capix IDE, or installable standalone.

## About

Capix Code is a full-featured AI coding agent with the Capix provider pre-configured as the default. It ships with:

- **Capix branding** — the TUI shows the Capix ASCII art banner on launch with brand colors (neon teal `#3DCED6`, green `#14F195`), the Capix brand mark logo, and a full TUI color theme using the brand palette (deep slate-navy canvas, teal accents, green success states)
- **Built-in Capix provider** — the `capix` provider is the default, using `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`, pointing at the Capix OpenAI-compatible gateway. No manual config needed.
- **Capix model catalog** — 8 pre-listed models including auto-routing (cheapest), Gemma 3 variants (27B/12B/4B), CodeGemma 7B, Qwen2.5-Coder 7B/32B, and Llama 3.3 70B
- **Auto-connect** — Capix IDE sets `CAPIX_BASE_URL` and `CAPIX_API_KEY` env vars in launched terminals from its SecretStorage, so `capix-code` works with zero additional setup
- **Dev Token rewards** — every commit you make with Capix Code mints DEV tokens to your wallet. Complete a session, deploy, or record a decision → more tokens. On-chain proof of useful development, exchangeable for SOL or CPX in the future.
- **Covenant governance** — safe defaults: edit/bash actions require approval, autoupdate disabled (IDE manages updates)

## Install

### Standalone

```bash
curl -fsSL https://capix.network/install-code.sh | bash
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm i -g capix-code
```

### Bundled in Capix IDE

Capix IDE ships `capix-code` in its PATH. When you click "Capix: Launch Capix Code", the IDE opens a terminal with `CAPIX_BASE_URL`, `CAPIX_API_KEY`, and `CAPIX_MODEL` env vars pre-set from your auto-connected LLM endpoint, then runs `capix-code`.

## Quick start

```bash
# Using the Capix gateway (auto-routes to the cheapest model):
export CAPIX_BASE_URL=https://capix.network/api/v1
export CAPIX_API_KEY=cpk_...        # from capix.network → API Keys
# CAPIX_MODEL defaults to "capix/auto" (cheapest route)

capix-code
```

Or with a self-deployed LLM endpoint:

```bash
export CAPIX_BASE_URL=http://94.23.x.x:12345/v1     # from /cloud/llm deploy result
export CAPIX_API_KEY=cpxllm_...                      # from the deploy response
export CAPIX_MODEL=capix/supergemma-gemma3-27b       # the model you deployed

capix-code
```

## Dev Tokens

Every time you do verifiable development with Capix Code, DEV tokens are minted to your wallet:

| Action | Reward |
|---|---|
| Commit code | +1 DEV |
| Deploy an app/agent/LLM | +5 DEV |
| Complete a productive session (50+ turns) | +10 DEV |
| Record an architectural decision | +2 DEV |
| Ship a complete product | +50 DEV |

Tokens are on-chain proof of useful work (Solana devnet pre-mainnet). In the future, DEV tokens will be exchangeable for SOL or CPX at launch — rewarding developers who built real products with Capix tools.

## How it works

Capix Code is a complete AI coding agent built on TypeScript/Bun. The repo is a brand kit — `scripts/bootstrap.sh` clones the full source, then `scripts/rebrand.sh` applies:

- Binary name: → `capix-code`
- Config dirs: `~/.config/capix-code/`
- Env var prefixes: `CAPIX_CODE_`
- The Capix provider config (`config/defaults.json`) as the bundled default
- The Capix TUI theme (`themes/capix.toml`) with brand colors
- The Capix launch banner (`brand/banner.ts`) with ASCII art + ANSI brand colors

## Building from source

Requires [Bun 1.3+](https://bun.sh).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ritzky/capix-code.git
cd capix-code
./scripts/bootstrap.sh    # clones source + applies branding + installs config + theme
./scripts/dev.sh          # launches in dev mode (Bun)
```

To build a standalone binary:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh        # produces dist/capix-code-<platform>/bin/capix-code
```

For CI/cross-platform release builds, tag a version:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
# The Release workflow builds mac (arm64/x64), linux (x64/arm64), windows (x64)
```

## Config

The default config (`config/defaults.json`) registers:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Provider ID | `capix` (via `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`) |
| Base URL | `CAPIX_BASE_URL` env var (defaults to `https://capix.network/api/v1`) |
| API Key | `CAPIX_API_KEY` env var |
| Default Model | `CAPIX_MODEL` env var (defaults to `capix/auto` — cheapest route) |
| Small Model | `capix/supergemma-gemma3-4b` (for lightweight tasks like titles) |
| Permission Mode | `edit: ask`, `bash: ask` (safe defaults) |
| Autoupdate | Disabled (IDE manages updates) |

Override anything in `~/.config/capix-code/opencode.json` or the project-level `capix-code.json`.
